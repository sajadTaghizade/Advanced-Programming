    Recursive Problem-Solving
  </h2>
  <p>
    This project is the second assignment for the Advanced Programming course. It is designed to provide hands-on experience with <strong>recursive thinking</strong> and its application to solve a variety of challenging problems, from mathematical puzzles to graph traversal. All problems are required to be solved using a recursive approach.

      <h3>
        Problem 1: Building Numbers with Ones
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a recursive optimization problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of '1's required to represent a given integer <em>n</em> using only the digit '1' and the basic operations of addition and subtraction. For example, the number 10 can be formed as <code>11 - 1</code>, which requires three '1's.

      <h3>
        Problem 2: Displaying Folder Structures
      </h3>
      <p>
        A classic tree-traversal problem that involves generating a visual representation of a file system directory structure, similar to the <code>tree</code> command in Linux. The program takes a list of files/folders and their parent-child relationships and recursively prints the hierarchy up to a specified depth, with precise indentation and branch characters.

        Problem 3: Metro Lines Shortest Path
      </h3>
      <p>
        A graph traversal problem focused on finding the minimum time to travel between two stations in a metro system. The system consists of multiple intersecting lines. The travel time is calculated based on the number of stations (1 minute each) and the number of line changes (2 minutes each). The solution requires a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible paths and identify the shortest one.
