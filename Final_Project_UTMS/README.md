    Final Project for Advanced Programming
  </h2>
  <p>
    This repository contains the final capstone project for the Advanced Programming course. The project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive <strong>University Management System (UTMS)</strong> with integrated social media features. It combines all the core concepts learned throughout the semester, including <strong>Object-Oriented Design</strong>, multi-file projects, and a client-server architecture.

## üöÄ Project Phases

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3>Phase 1: Core Logic & Command-Line Interface</h3>
  </summary>
  <p>
    The first phase focused on building the entire backend logic of the UTMS application. All interactions were handled through a custom Command-Line Interface (CLI) that accepted commands with specific methods (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>) and arguments.
  </p>
  <h4>Key Features Implemented:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>User Authentication</strong>: Secure login/logout for all user types.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Social Platform</strong>: Creating, viewing, and deleting posts; viewing user profiles; and establishing two-way connections between users.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Academic System</strong>: Admins can offer courses, and students can enroll/drop based on complex validation rules (prerequisites, major, schedule conflicts).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>TA Recruitment</strong>: Professors can create and close TA application forms, and students can submit their applications.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3>Phase 2: Web Server & HTML Interface</h3>
  </summary>
  <p>
    In the second phase, the CLI was replaced with a graphical user interface on the web. The backend logic from Phase 1 was exposed through a web server built using a provided C++ HTTP library. The frontend was created using HTML, transforming the application into a functional client-server model.
  </p>
  <h4>Key Features Implemented:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Web Server</strong>: Handled GET and POST requests to serve dynamic content.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Session Management</strong>: Used Session IDs to manage logged-in users across different requests.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>HTML Interface</strong>: Created web pages for all major functionalities, including a login page, user homepages, forms for creating posts, course enrollment, and TA applications, all with image upload capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: The project had optional extensions for using CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactive elements.
    </li>
  </ul>
